### Hand lettering presets

The dialogue presets are color coded blue, red and yellow. The display/effects presets are orange.

Red is the average lettering group. This was created to emulate typical comic book lettering, as you would find in old Marvel comics. Blue is the angled group, which is for more cartoonish lettering.

The lettering presets are mostly straightforward. You'll likely always have to resize them for the job at hand.

The block line presets Trip and Trope, however, are extremely difficult to use. You have to handle the stylus very carefully at line ends to avoid disaster, because when you lift the stylus the line thinks you're about to go in another direction. Zap is offered as an easy alternative, with a line that fakes a block end.
