The dialogue presets are color coded blue, red and yellow. The display/effects presets are orange.

Red is the average lettering group. This was created to emulate typical comic book lettering, as you would find in old Marvel comics. Blue is the angled group, which is for more cartoonish lettering.

The lettering presets are mostly straightforward. You'll likely always have to resize them for the job at hand.

The block line presets Trip and Trope, however, are extremely difficult to use. You have to handle the stylus very carefully at line ends to avoid disaster, because when you lift the stylus the line thinks you're about to go in another direction. Zap is offered as an easy alternative, with a line that fakes a block end.

Special presets for manipulating your work in a variety of magical ways. It was difficult to come up with icons to represent the actions of each preset, we did our best.

The first two presets are for eliminating anti-aliasing, reducing art to pure bitmap.

There are presets for working with virtual blueline. The blue-to-white preset converts any bright color to white. You can then use white-to-clear to eliminate it altogether. Blue-to-gray and gray-to-blue lets you convert pencils between blueline and gray.

The blue-to-gold preset inverts everything.

The presets with the leaning boxes lets you twist areas of art in one direction or another.

The presets with slices through the boxes are gutter tools. You can use this in conjunction with layer style/stroke to create panel layouts.
